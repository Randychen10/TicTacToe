This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in C++. It features a 3x3 grid where two players, represented by 'X' and 'O', take turns to mark spaces on the board. The main functionalities include:

Board Display: A visual representation of the board is shown after each turn, allowing players to see their moves and the current game state.

Move Validation: Each player selects a row and column for their move. The program ensures the cell is unoccupied and within bounds before marking the board, prompting the player to choose again if necessary.

Win and Draw Conditions: After each turn, the program checks if either player has won by completing a row, column, or diagonal. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

User Interaction: The game takes user input for each move, providing prompts and feedback to guide players through each turn.

The program uses basic C++ features, such as arrays and conditionals, to manage the game state and logic. It's a simple yet effective example of interactive game programming in C++â€‹(TicTacToe.cpp).
